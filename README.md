The AI revolution is grabbing headlines, but another revolution is underway in health: Ozempic 

GLP-1s (others include Mounjaro, Zepbound), repurposed Type 2 Diabetes medications, have proven as efficacious and safer than traditional surgical interventions 

-- 

problem: 70% of Americans are overweight and 61% of teens experience body disatisfication 

solutions: two powerful non-surgical solutions exist

1. GLP-1s
2. 1-on-1 personal training and nutrition counselling  

I'm interested in: 

1. Which one is an appropriate first-line or second-line therapy? Or should they be started at the same time for certain patients or all patients?
2. Does solution #2 solve the muscle wasting problem of solution #1?
3. Will patients who receive solution #1 be more receptive to solution #2? 
4. How can we use tech to broaden financial and logistical access to both?
5. How can we use tech to optimize the vast data collection possibilities in the gym and the kitchen to make #2 more efficient, helping customers get results faster and with less pain?
6. How can AI be used to enable trainers and nutritionists to help more customers efficiently?

I'm motivated to work on this problem because: 
1. I've struggled with my own body image growing up and after transforming my body with personal trainers, want to share that relief of restored self-confidence with every young person
2. America's obesity epidemic is a public health crises. The food industry needs to be much more regulated (you will lose weight just eating in Europe because they have much stricter regulations on ingredients), but concurrently there needs to be a re-education on nutrition and exercise: the value of a high protein diet, caloric surplus/maintenance/deficit and when you go on which, the importance of resistance training and how to work-out efficiently

When I was in college @ UChicago, my co-founder and I built an Airbnb for personal training, so students can book 1-on-1 training sessions with student atheletes in our school's gym

They took turns working out together, and the student athelete acted as a mentor, guiding and demonstrating how to do each exercise, and working out with the student customer 3x a week 

Mentors loved teaching, and they were getting paid to do their usual workout 

Mentees loved it because they were paying $20/hr instead of the usual $100/hr of commercial personal training, and they made a friend in the process 

Both parties ended up with almost perfect adherence to the gym, and consistency x time = amazing physical results

This is one way to tech-enable solution #2 so that it can reach millions of Americans at scale

However, I'm thinking of how to integrate #1 into this marketplace business 

Should we also dispense the GLP-1 medications like Noom and Found are doing? Or should we also let other players do the dispensing and we target their customers with a complementary service, assuming they will desire more after losing weight?
